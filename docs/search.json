I think I should look at them as formative indicators, like Howlett et al. (2021).\nReflective Motivation\n\nThe item ref_mot_1_2 is negatively correlated with the rest of the items. This is reverse scored item “I want to ensure I can always provide enough food for family and guests”. It is content-wise quite far from motivation to avoid waste. After removal alpha increases to .83.\nref_mot_2_5, “I believe that the risk of becoming ill as a result of avoiding food waste is high”, has an item-rest correlation of .01. I think this item is confusing (a translator also asked clarification) and does not clearly correspond with motivation to avoid food waste. alpha after removal increases to .85.\nref_mot_2_4, “I don’t want to waste food because I’m afraid other people will think that I’m ungrateful”, quite poor item-rest correlation of 0.16. I think this may be a poor fit for reflective motivation, it is more social opportunity (though also fits poorly there). May be appropriate as a formative indicator? Removing it increases alpha to .87.\nref_mot_1_5, “I am convinced the food waste problem will be solved”, now stands out with poorest item-rest correlation of .31 and alpha would increase if removed, but not as substantially (to .88).\n\nAutomatic Motivation\n\naut_mot_1_3, “Avoiding food waste is something I do automatically, without thinking”, has the poorest fit, but not too bad. I did add this one just to have habit somewhere, but it is not included in the TDF. Maybe habit does not fit inside the COM-B?\naut_mot_1_4, “It is important to avoid wasting food”, is theoretically not a great fit for automatic motivation either, this is also outside the TDF and is a better fit for reflective motivation (where it does increase alpha to .89 with item-rest r of .66)\naut_mot_1_1, “When I avoid wasting food, I feel like I am making a difference”, sounds more like beliefs about capabilities TDF construct rather than reinforcement, which is reflective motivation. Maybe the distinction between reflective and automatic motivation is not really feasible in self-report.\n\nThe emotion question is the only one I do think fits this automatic motivation more than reflective.\n\n\nSome items ( ref_mot_1_2 ) were negatively correlated with the total scale and \nprobably should be reversed.  \nTo do this, run the function again with the 'check.keys=TRUE' option\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\nSD\nMedian\nn\nCronbach's Alpha\n\n\n\n\nPsychological Capability (5 items)\n5.28\n0.90\n5.40\n584\n0.71\n\n\nPhysical Opportunity (2 items)\n5.73\n0.96\n6.00\n585\n0.62\n\n\nSocial Opportunity (2 items)\n4.80\n1.17\n5.00\n586\n0.57\n\n\nReflective Motivation (15 items)\n5.11\n0.67\n5.20\n580\n0.80\n\n\nAutomatic Motivation (4 items)\n5.64\n0.92\n5.75\n585\n0.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation matrices for the COM-B components"

His first full model also has SRMR of .7 (does not report any of the other fit statistics), and then trims it to only the significant ones. Suggesting that only those are relevant for the constructs. For me it would be:\nCapability:\n\nbehaviour regulation\nmemory, attention, decision making\n\nOpportunity:\n\nphysical opportunity (environmental context and resources)\ndescriptive norm\n\nReflective motivation:\n\nbeliefs about capabilities/self-efficacy\nintention\n\nAutomatic motivation:\n\nhabit strength\n\nBut this is all based on 1-item measures so that’s not a very strong argument."
